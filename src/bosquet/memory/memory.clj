;; https://gentopia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agent_components.html#long-short-term-memory
;; Memory component is used for one of the following purposes:

;; - Escaping context limitation of LLMs. eg. when you expect a very long
;;   conversation or task solving trajectory, exceeding the max_token limit
;;   of LLMs.

;; - Saving token consumption. eg. when you expect to have lengthy and
;;   unnecessary tool response (like Wikipedia Search) stored in-context.

;; memory stream, a long-term memory module that records, in natural language,
;; a comprehensive list of the agentâ€™s experiences.
;; A memory retrieval model combines relevance, recency, and importance to
;; surface the records needed to inform the agentâ€™s moment-to-moment behavior.

;; The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record of the agentâ€™s experience.
;; It is a list of memory objects, where each object contains a natural language
;; description, a creation timestamp, and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element
;; of the memory stream is an observation, which is an event directly
;; perceived by an agent.
;;
;; Components of memory retrieval
;; - recency
;; - relevancy
;; - importance
;; - reflection
;;
;; Encode: Chunking, Semantic, Metadata
;; Store: Atom, VectorDB
;; Retrieve: Sequential, Cueue, Query
